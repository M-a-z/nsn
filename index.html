<h3 class="header2">What is nsn</h3>
<p class="normal_chapter">
nsn is a tool written for reporting changes in network interfaces. Nsn can be used to monitor changes in
<ul>
<li>interfaces</li>
<li>addresses</li>
<li>routes</li>
<li>neighbor cache</li>
<li>rules</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal_chapter">
and possibly some other network stack related features. Nsn can also be used to execute commands when state changes are observed. 
<p class="normal_chapter">
Nsn is written in c, and usees netlink sockets to receive change notifications from kernel. Its sources are written so they can be used as simple netlink socket usage example.

<h3 class="header2">Compilation and installation</h3>
<p class="normal_chapter">
Compilation should be easy. Just go to folder where Makefile resides and type
<p class="command_example">
make 
<p class="normal_chapter">
which builds the binary and optionally 
<p class="command_example">
make install 
<p class="normal_chapter">
which generates man pages and installs binaries to system folder. NSN really depends only on librt (for getting accurate timings for events) and compilation should thus be fairly painless. In case you find any problems, just give me a nudge =) Oh, I keep forgetting -static flag in Makefile. If you fail with linking, please try changing line
<p class="command_example">
LDFLAGS=-lrt -static
<p class="normal_chapter">
to
<p class="command_example">
LDFLAGS=-lrt
<p class="normal_chapter">

<h3 class="header2">More information</h3>
<p class="normal_chapter">
Nsn provides minimal help when ran with --help option.
<p class="command_example">
nsn --help
<p class="normal_chapter">
Man pages come with package and can be viewd using command
<p class="command_example">
man nsn
<p class="normal_chapter">
They are also available <a href="http://maz-programmersdiary.blogspot.fi/2012/06/nsn-man-page.html">online</a>. Note that online version is not updated regularly. However man pages included in release should always be specific to downloaded release.

NOTE: This is still development version, thus it may not be bugfree.<br>
